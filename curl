# Curl does not cache any requests on the client side; therefore, any caching when using Curl occurs on the server side. 
# To bypass the server-side cache, you can use the Cache-Control HTTP header to control the caching behavior.

curl https://<FQDN-or-IP> \
  -H "Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" \
  -H "Pragma: no-cache" \
  -H "Expires: 0" 

# show request / response headers
curl -v $URL
